## Why Iâ€™m Starting to Blog

I've never considered myself to be one of immense amounts of personal reflection, but certainly very insightful. Over my time in formal education, I have ran across so many interesting pieces of information and stories that I know longer remember. In addition, much of my tech journey has been guided by individual blogs and posts detailing how to do certain things. My journey through Unraid, and then Truenas was driven by the community. A lot of my statistical knowledge was furthered by blog posts and explainers. I know hope to use this platform as a place to store the most interesting pieces of information and projects that I have built. I hope to be able to provide blog posts and explainers that the next learners will be able to use. 

Hope you enjoy!
