- “Create a welcoming atmosphere to make participants feel at ease.”
- “Listen more than you speak.
- Try to capture the thoughts and behaviors of your participants accurately.
- Go to your participants’ environments—wherever they’ll be engaged in the behavior you’re studying.
- Tell them the goal of your study briefly, being careful that it doesn’t direct their responses.
- Encourage participants to act naturally and share their thoughts aloud.
- Do not ask leading or yes-or-no questions. Follow up with more questions to clarify their responses.
- Write out your questions in advance, but feel free to deviate in the moment.
- Take pictures to create visual notes of your observations. 
- Pay attention even after you stop recording—you might be surprised by what gets said”

Observations -> attributes -> design mandates



## Competitive analysis:

- “How do they explicitly position themselves? What do they say they offer?
- Who do they appear to be targeting? How does this overlap or differ from your target audience or users?
- What are the key differentiators? The factors that make them uniquely valuable to their target market, if any?
- To what extent do they embody each of your positive/negative attributes?
- How do the user needs or wants they’re serving overlap or differ from those that you’re serving or desire to serve?
- What are they doing particularly well or badly?
- Based on this assessment, where do you see emerging or established conventions in how they do things, opportunities to offer something clearly superior, or good practices you’ll need to adopt or take into consideration to compete with them?”
