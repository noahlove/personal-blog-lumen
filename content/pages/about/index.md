I’m a cloud engineer and a blogger based in Montana, currently working at a SaaS startup.  I expect this blog to be mainly focused on AWS, Truenas, startups, espresso and just interesting stories. The opinions in this blog are my own and don’t represent the company I work for. 

You can reach me at noah@designs2love or on Twitter at @noahjameslove. Feel free to send questions, blog post requests, and any kind of feedback really.
